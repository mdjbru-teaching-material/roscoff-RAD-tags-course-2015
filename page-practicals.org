* Plan

The practicals are done in two parts:
- A *detailed analysis*, from raw reads to final results, of a dataset from a
  paper published in 2013: [[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05749.x/abstract][Molecular evolutionary and population genomic analysis of the 
  nine-spined stickleback using a modified restriction-site-associated DNA tag approach]]. 
  The raw dataset is available from the Dryad data archive, doi:
  [[http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.44sf1][10.5061/dryad.44sf1]]. We will try to *reproduce* the results from the paper,
  *criticize* the different steps and maybe *try different approaches* as we
  go.

  After this part, you should have a general view of a RAD-seq workflow.
- A *more specific look* at some precise steps of the analysis, using other
  published datasets. This might entail, for example, genotype calling using a
  maximum likelihood approach.

* Detailed instructions

During the practicals, we will be using an Etherpad document to share code. You
can access the Etherpad document [[https://etherpad.fr/p/1DAjASHRdI][here]].
