** FASTA and FASTQ format

Many high-throughput sequencing methods produce reads in a format called
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format][FASTQ]]. This format is very similar to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format][FASTA]] format, but in addition to the
nucleotide sequence itself it also contains some *quality information* for each
position.

In the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format][FASTA]] format, each record has two elements: 
- the line starting with =>= contains the record name
- the next line contain the nucleotide sequence

#+BEGIN_SRC verb
>myLittleSeq
AATTCCCACAGAATCCCTCGANGGACTGCAAGGCAGCAGCCCATTGCCTAAAAAGGAAGAGTGCACACAGA
#+END_SRC

In the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format][FASTQ]] format, each record has four elements:
- the line starting with =@= contains the record name and precedes the sequence
- the next line is the nucleotide sequence
- the line starting with =+= repeats the record name and precedes the quality
  information
- the next line contains the quality score for each position (one character per
  position)

#+BEGIN_SRC verb
@myLittleSeq

BBBBBBB?ABABB@BBB6B?6%6>9B;@BA=;ABAACBABA?=?@AAB>8.(.);@:>BBA7@C@.<(0B8
#+END_SRC

The quality score for each position is encoded in one character and can be
converted to a numerical value. This score tells how confident the sequencer is
about the identity of the base at this position of the sequence. One format for
quality score used by Illumina is the Phred score.

** Phred quality score

The quality information in the FASTQ can be encoded as a quality score such as
the commonly used [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score][Phred score]]. The type of score encoding for a FASTQ file
depends on the sequencing platform format.

The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score][Phred score]] gives the probability that the base identity in the sequence is
correct at this position. The higher the score, the higher probability that the
base call is correct. The relation between the quality score =Q= and the
probability of *incorrect* base assignment =P= is:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
Q = -10.log(P) where log is the decimal log operation
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: Phred quality scores and correct/incorrect base call probabilities
#+BEGIN_SRC 
| Phred score | Prob(incorrect base) | Prob(correct base) |
|-------------+-------------------+-----------------|
|          10 |               0.1 |         0.90000 |
|          20 |              0.01 |         0.99000 |
|          30 |             0.001 |         0.99900 |
|          40 |            0.0001 |         0.99990 |
|          50 |           0.00001 |         0.99999 |
#+END_SRC

Typically, the Phred score numerical value is encoded to the FASTQ file by
adding a fixed, constant value and converting the resulting number to an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters][ASCII
character]]. For example, if the encoding is [Phred+33] as it is for Sanger or
Illumina 1.8+, then a Phred score of 50 is encoded as "S" in the FASTQ file
since 50+33=83 and the ASCII character for 83 is "S". The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding][wikipedia page]] about
the quality score encoding in FASTQ file has more detailed information and
examples about it.

** Raw reads files
*** TODO Have a look at the raw reads files

Go into the raw reads folder and list its content by typing:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd 01_raw_reads
ls -lh
#+END_SRC
=ls= lists the content of the current folder, and the =-l= and =-h= options ask
for a detailed list and for human-readable sizes, respectively.

The raw reads are separated into several files, one per lane per sense (forward
or reverse reads):
#+BEGIN_SRC verb
s_1_1_sequence.fastq
s_1_2_sequence.fastq
s_2_1_sequence.fastq
s_2_2_sequence.fastq
s_3_1_sequence.fastq
s_3_2_sequence.fastq
s_5_1_sequence.fastq
s_5_2_sequence.fastq
s_6_1_sequence.fastq
s_6_2_sequence.fastq
#+END_SRC

The file name format is: =s_xxx_yyy_sequence.fastq= where:
- =xxx= is the sequencing lane (1, 2, 3, 5 or 6 here)
- =yyy= is the read direction (1 for FORWARD reads, 2 for REVERSE reads - we
  used paired-end sequencing, remember)

For example, =s_1_1_sequence.fastq= and =s_1_2_sequence.fastq= are the
sequences from lane 1, forward and reverse reads, respectively.

Get a look at the file by typing:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
head s_1_1_sequence.fastq
#+END_SRC

The =head= command displays the first 10 lines of a file. Can you recognize
which lines contain record names? Record sequences? Quality scores?

** Count the number of reverse reads for each population

Each population pool was barcoded on one side of the RAD fragment, which
corresponds to the *reverse* reads here. The barcodes were three letter long,
and were linked to the restriction site of ENZ1. This means that the reverse
reads must start by one of those eight sequences:
#+BEGIN_SRC verb
| Pop | Lane | Barcode | Rev start |
|-----+------+---------+-----------|
| BYN |    1 | CAC     | CACTCC    |
| RYT |    1 | CTT     | CTTTCC    |
| HKI |    2 | TCT     | TCTTCC    |
| PYÖ |    3 | CTT     | CTTTCC    |
| ABB |    3 | TTG     | TTGTCC    |
| SKA |    5 | CAC     | CACTCC    |
| LEV |    5 | TCT     | TCTTCC    |
| POR |    6 | TTG     | TTGTCC    |
#+END_SRC

We see that there are two populations pooled in each of lanes 1, 3 and 5, but
only one population in each of lanes 2 and 6.

*** TODO Count the number of reverse reads for HKI population

Let's start with something simple and look at lane 2. There is only one
population, HKI, so all the reverse reads in =s_2_2_sequence.fastq= should
start with =TCTTCC=.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
head s_2_2_sequence.fastq
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

#+END_EXAMPLE
Does the first sequences fulfil this expectation?

Of course we do not really want to check manually that each sequence starts
with the correct pattern by visual inspection. One way is to count the total
number of sequences in the file, and another is to count the number of
sequences starting with the correct pattern. Hopefully the numbers match...

To count the total number of sequences in the file, we can count its lines with
the command =wc -l= and then divide by four since each record has four lines:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wc -l s_2_2_sequence.fastq
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1942408 s_2_2_sequence.fastq
#+END_EXAMPLE
How many reads are there in total in this file?

Now we can count the number of sequences starting with =TCTTCC= by using the
=grep= command and counting the number of lines of its output with =wc -l=. The
=grep= command looks for a given pattern in the lines of a file, and output the
matching lines only. The pattern we use for the match is ="^TCTTCC"=. The =^=
tells =grep= that the string should match at the beginning of a line only, not
in the middle of it. The output of =grep= is then sent to =wc -l= with a pipe
=|= so that =wc= will tell us how many matching lines =grep= returned. A pipe
sends the output of the first command as an input to the second command.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep "^TCTTCC" s_2_2_sequence.fastq | wc -l
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
485602
#+END_EXAMPLE
Do the two numbers match? Is everything as expected? Is our approach robust or
can it fail in some cases?

*** TODO Count the number of reverse reads for BYN and RYT populations

The BYN population shared lane 1 with the RYT population. Reverse reads from
both populations are in =s_1_2_sequence.fastq=. To count the number of reads
for BYN, we can again use =grep= and the appropriate pattern:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep "^CACTCC" s_1_2_sequence.fastq | wc -l
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
187008
#+END_EXAMPLE
And we can do the same for RYT:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep "^CTTTCC" s_1_2_sequence.fastq | wc -l
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
599202
#+END_EXAMPLE
Finally, we can check that everything makes sense by counting the total number
of reads in =s_1_2_sequence.fastq=:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wc -l s_1_2_sequence.fastq
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC 
3144840
#+END_SRC
Do the number match? Does everything make sense?

*** TODO Count the number of reverse reads for the other populations

You can now obtain the number of reverse reads for all the populations. Compare
the number of reads between populations. Is the coverage homogeneous? Can you
explain what you observe?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Pop | Lane | Barcode | Rev start | N reads |
|-----+------+---------+-----------+---------|
| BYN |    1 | CAC     | CACTCC    |  187008 |
| RYT |    1 | CTT     | CTTTCC    |  599202 |
| HKI |    2 | TCT     | TCTTCC    |  485602 |
| PYÖ |    3 | CTT     | CTTTCC    |  675123 |
| ABB |    3 | TTG     | TTGTCC    |  428807 |
| SKA |    5 | CAC     | CACTCC    |   81633 |
| LEV |    5 | TCT     | TCTTCC    |  376011 |
| POR |    6 | TTG     | TTGTCC    |  333744 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Plot your results in a bar plot with R. You can do it by yourself if you know
how to do, or you can use the code below:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
# *** R script ***

# Summary plot for reverse reads abundance
# ----------------------------------------

# Input the data
pop = c("BYN", "RYT", "HKI", "PYO", "ABB", "SKA", "LEV", "POR")
habitat = c("Pond", "Pond", "Marine", "Pond", "Pond", "Lake", "Marine", "Lake")
n_reads = c(187008, 599202, 485602, 675123, 428807, 81633, 376011, 333744)

# Bar plot 
barplot(n_reads,            # numerical values used for the plot
  names.arg = pop,          # names for each bar
  col = as.factor(habitat), # col is determined by the factor "habitat"
  las = 1,                  # orientation of the y-axis numbers
  ylab = "N reads")         # label for y-axis
#+END_SRC

** Barcode and restriction-site checking and demultiplexing

In our case, the reads are already quite clean since there is no reads starting
with an unexpected pattern. However, it is possible to have reads that do have
mistakes at the beginning of the sequence, and that should be discarded because
they cannot be assigned to a population for example.

In practice, there are methods to correct the barcode for one base mismatch
when the barcodes used for different populations are sufficiently different to
start with (see for example the STACKS pipeline).

*** Detect errors in the barcode and restriction site while demultiplexing

Here, we'll just see how to detect those mistakes while demultiplexing,
i.e. while sorting the reads from one file into one file per population. The
file =s_5_2_sequence.fastq=, which contains the reverse reads for two
populations, was transformed to a low quality file,
=s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq= in which some nucleotide were randomly changed
(the Phred scores themselves were not touched).

Reads in =s_5_2_sequence.fastq= should start with either =CACTCC= (SKA
population) or =TCTTCC= (LEV population). Let's filter the reads from the
modified file, =s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq= to separate files for each
population, and to a third file for reads that do not match the expected
patterns.

*** TODO Extract the reverse reads from SKA

We use =grep= again. Since we want to extract full records, not only the
nucleotide sequences that matches the pattern, we use =-B 1= (extract one line
before the match) and =-A 2= (extract two lines after the matching line). We
send =grep= output to a file by using the redirection operator =>=.

In addition, =grep= will add a =--= line between groups of contiguous
matches. We do not want to keep it in our output file, so we filter that out
with a reverse =grep=: a =grep= call with the =-v= option which asks =grep= to
output only the lines that do *not* match the pattern.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep -B 1 -A 2 "^CACTCC" s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq > SKA-rev.to-clean.fastq
grep -v "^\-" SKA-rev.to-clean.fastq > SKA-rev.final.fastq
#+END_SRC

We could do all in one go, without the intermediate =SKA-rev.to-clean.fastq=
file which contains the =--= lines, by using a pipe between the two =grep=
calls:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep -B 1 -A 2 "^CACTCC" s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq | grep -v "^\-" > SKA-rev.fastq
#+END_SRC

Now we can count the number of sequence in =SKA-rev.fastq=:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep "^@" SKA-rev.fastq | wc -l
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
81235
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** TODO Extract the reverse reads from LEV

Let's do the same for the LEV population:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep -B 1 -A 2 "^TCTTCC" s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq | grep -v "^\-" > LEV-rev.fastq
grep "^@" LEV-rev.fastq | wc -l
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
374311
#+END_EXAMPLE

And the total number of initial sequences was:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep "^@" s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq | wc -l
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
457644
#+END_EXAMPLE

Were there any reads which were not sent to the SKA nor to the LEV file? How
many was this? Can you imagine a way to get those reads to examine their
sequence?

*** TODO Get the reads names for each population

To do things in a more rigorous way, we can actually create one list of reads
names for each population. Those lists will help us to sort the reads later on.

As an example, let's get all the names of the reverse reads for BYN. We can do
it in two steps: first we extract the full records of the reverse reads
starting with =CACTCC= (BYN specific pattern), and then we extract only the
lines containing the reads names. Let's =grep= again!

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep -B 1 -A 2 "^CACTCC" s_1_2_sequence.fastq | grep "^@" > BYN.rev.names
#+END_SRC

Prepare a list of reverse reads names for each population, using the
=s_2_5_sequence.lowQual.fastq= instead of the =s_2_5_sequence.fastq=.

*** TODO Get the reads with unexpected pattern in =s_2_5_sequence.fastq=

Now you should have a list of the reverse reads for SKA and LEV:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep -B 1 -A 2 "^CACTCC" s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq | grep "^@" > SKA.rev.names
grep -B 1 -A 2 "^TCTTCC" s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq | grep "^@" > LEV.rev.names
#+END_SRC

We can also prepare the list of all reads in the initial file:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep "^@" s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq > all.names
#+END_SRC

Now, by using inverted =grep= and by giving a file (with the =-f= option)
containing the patterns to match to =grep=, we can get the names which were not
assigned to SKA nor to LEV. We also use the =-F= option to tell =grep= the
pattern are fix, not regular expressions, to make it faster:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep -F -v -f SKA.rev.names all.names > names.not.in.SKA
grep -F -v -f LEV.rev.names names.not.in.SKA > names.not.in.SKA.nor.LEV
#+END_SRC

Great! Now we can use this list of non-matching names to get their actual
sequences and see what were the problems:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
grep -F -A 1 -f names.not.in.SKA.nor.LEV s_5_2_sequence.lowQual.fastq > bad.seqs
#+END_SRC

If we look at =bad.seqs= with =less= for example (=less bad.seqs=), we can see
that there is one mismatch in the first 6 nucleotides.

** Complete demultiplexing

*** TODO Demultiplex the forward and reverse reads

Similar to demultiplexing, even though the multiplexing is not really high
here.

*** TODO Diagnostic plots with R

A few diagnostic plots to see how to see how the data look like. For example,
the number of reads varies between populations. Discussion about issues, the
barcode effects, how to fix that, and similar potential issues within the pools
(how some individuals can have more reads than others, mutations that break the
restriction site).

** Quality control
